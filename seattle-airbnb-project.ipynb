review related columns exhibit a similar missing value ratio of around 17%, suggesting that these missing values are primarily from properties with zero reviews. However, it is important to decide whether to include these properties in our analysis. Properties with zero reviews could have various reasons for not having any reviews. It could be due to the properties being inherently unattractive, the owner listing the properties for other purposes, or the host being new to the platform with a relatively short time on the market.\n\nTo assess the impact of including these properties, we examined the distribution of years that properties with zero reviews have been listed on Airbnb, which shows that 42% of these properties were listed for less than a year. To reduce uncertainty in the model, we have decided to remove these \"outliers\" from further analysis.","metadata":{"id":"pRn56j6ypMEv","papermill":{"duration":0.013236,"end_time":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.209541","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.196305","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"f, axs = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(5,5))\n(df_listings_filtered_amenities.query(\"number_of_reviews==0\").host_since_deltaDays/365).plot(kind=\"hist\")\nax = plt.gca()\nax.set_title(\"The Distribution of Years on Airbnb for Properties with No Reviews \")\nax.set_xlabel(\"year\");\nax.set_ylabel(\"count\");\nf.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.239052Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.238646Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.591799Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.590194Z"},"id":"rNbc1ZmppMEv","outputId":"87629206-6062-45e4-e94d-f4c0489e2b93","papermill":{"duration":0.371956,"end_time":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.595148","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.223192","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Drop samples with zero reviews\n# We see that the majority of missing values gone with these properties\ndf_listings_filtered_amenities = df_listings_filtered_amenities.query('number_of_reviews>0')\nprint(df_listings_filtered_amenities.isna().mean().sort_values(ascending=False).head(35))\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.627054Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.625843Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.652223Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.650772Z"},"id":"-jEOB23hpMEv","outputId":"23bc566e-3c52-464d-cc5b-12909e175195","papermill":{"duration":0.045525,"end_time":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.655022","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-17T19:26:28.609497","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To handle missing data in our dataset, I adopted two different strategies based on the data type of each feature.

is not surprising to see that super hosts receive more reviews and higher ratings compared to other hosts. This can be attributed to their quick response rate and their focus on safety, which includes verifying travelers and themselves on multiple platforms.\n\nWhen analyzing the features that significantly distinguish super hosts from other hosts, it was found that almost half of these features were amenities. Interestingly, the most impactful feature was _Shampoo_, while _Kitchen_ barely crossed the significance threshold. This is understandable as travelers usually have limited time for cooking and prioritize taking a good shower and getting a good night's sleep during their short-term stays.\n\nDespite the superiority of super hosts' properties, it might be assumed that they charge premium prices. However, statistically, this is not the case. One interesting feature is _calculated_host_listings_count_, which indicates the number of properties owned by the host. It appears that companies and owners who own multiple properties cannot pay enough attention to each property, while super hosts typically own only 1 or 2 properties.\n\nTherefore, the answer to Q1 is yes! As a traveler, you should prioritize booking Airbnb units hosted by super hosts. This will allow you to enjoy better living conditions without worrying about being overcharged.

To address this, I decided to use the product of \"<i>review_scores_rating</i>\" and \"<i>reviews_per_month</i>\" as the metric, which provides a more comprehensive view of the property's overall satisfaction level and popularity.\n\nTo avoid redundancy, it's important to remove any review and rating related features in the dataset, as they are already accounted for in the metric I created.

For instance, amenities such as _Shampoo_ and _Essentials_ have a positive impact on the performance of an Airbnb unit. However, properties with a _Hot Tub_ may have a negative effect. Furthermore, it is uncommon to find a property with a pool in downtown Seattle, and these properties are likely to be located in rural areas, far from the city's major attractions.\n\nI have not personally visited Seattle, but it is interesting to note that the _longitude_ and _latitude_ coefficients are the smallest negative values. This suggests that the northeastern part of Seattle may not be the best area to search for properties. To confirm this finding, I looked up the crime rate distribution in Seattle (the figure below), and the results support this observation.\n\nTherefore, for Q2, it is recommended to avoid searching for properties in the northeastern part of Seattle and prioritize properties in the downtown area, which typically offer luxurious amenities such as Heating and Wireless Internet. It is also advisable to rent out the property as an entire apartment or private rooms rather than a shared room.","metadata":{"id":"8NieFwa2pME0","papermill":{"duration":0.018828,"end_time":"2023-04-17T19:26:32.142484","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-17T19:26:32.123656","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://images.crimegrade.org/map/crime-rate-maps/safest-places-in-seattle-wa-metro.webp)","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.018603,"end_time":"2023-04-17T19:26:32.179845","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-17T19:26:32.161242","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n<a id=\"q3\"></a>\n# 2.5 Q3.

While the year-over-year growth rate remained above 1.0 throughout the years, there was a major drop in 2012 and 2013. Such fluctuations in year-over-year growth rates are not uncommon in business markets, as they can be unstable and misleading in the early years of development.
